# SyntaxHighlighter

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jc-progjava/syntaxhighlighter/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jc-progjava/syntaxhighlighter)

A syntax highlighting tool made with Java, HTML, CSS & JS.

### Supported Languages
This tool supports syntax highlighting in:
- Java (Versions â‰¤16)
- (More will be added over time)

### How to use
There are two versions of the syntax highlighter:
- Java source: compile and run `SyntaxHighlighter.java`. Follow the input prompts (to input filepath), and run the program. It should output a file `index.html` that contains a HTML rendering of your code after syntax highlighting.
- Javascript & CSS source: attach these files to your webpages to have all `<code>` tags syntax highlighted.

There are some example output files (.html) in the examples folder that you can take a look at.

### Examples
You can take a look at example output files [here](https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/SyntaxHighlighter/tree/main/examples). See live previews in the links below:
- [SmartEditor.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JC-ProgJava/SyntaxHighlighter/main/examples/smarteditor.html) ([source repository](https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/SmartEditor.java))
- [index.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JC-ProgJava/SyntaxHighlighter/main/examples/index.html)
- Try highlighting your own source code [here](https://jc-progjava.github.io/SyntaxHighlighter/)!

### Features
- Support for Java 16 (multiline strings, records, new keywords [permits, record, sealed, non-sealed])
- Customizable (through the CSS file for the JS version. You can also customize the Java version by tweaking the CSS selector values. See what the different classes represent [here](https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/SyntaxHighlighter/blob/main/src/Java/TokenType.java))
- Simple and small: the entire JS script file is less than 600 lines long (~15KB). After minification and zipping, the JS file only takes up **2KB** of space.

### Why use this syntax highlighter?
- It is easy to use: just download the JS script and CSS files and link them using `<link>` and `<script>` to webpages and get fully syntax-highlighted code in `<code>` tags. For the Java version, just input the filepath and you get a HTML code file with the syntax-highlighted version of your source file.
- It is simple and small: as listed in the Features section, the entire JS file is only **2KB** after minification and compression. The expanded (and beautified (done using this [tool](https://prettier.io/))) version is also easy to read and understand for developers who are curious how syntax highlighters are made.
- It doesn't require any external dependencies.
