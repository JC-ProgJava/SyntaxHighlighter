# SyntaxHighlighter
A syntax highlighting tool made with Java, HTML, CSS & JS.

#### Supported Languages
This tool supports syntax highlighting in:
- Java (Versions â‰¤16)
(More will be added over time)

#### How to use
There are two versions of the syntax highlighter:
- Java source: compile and run `SyntaxHighlighter.java`. Follow the input prompts (to input filepath), and run the program. It should output a file `index.html` that contains a HTML rendering of your code after syntax highlighting.
- Javascript & CSS source: attach these files to your webpages to have all `<code>` tags syntax highlighted.

There are some example output files (.html) in the examples folder that you can take a look at.
